# Tenzies Game

This project is a React-based interactive game inspired by the classic Tenzies dice game. The goal is to collect all dice showing the same value as quickly as possible. Players can hold dice values they want to keep and reroll the remaining dice until all match.

The app demonstrates state management, component-based architecture, and interactive UI feedback in a React environment.
